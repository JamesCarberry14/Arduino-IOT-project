# Arduino-IOT-project:

This is an Arduino scrip that allows the user to use the arduino as a temperature sensor,
which is used to determine whether an object is too hot, too cold, or at a good temerature.

The main purpose of this device will be for use in households, to ensure that drinks are a suitable temperature
for consumption by small children, but it can also be used to ensure other objects are within a certain temperature
